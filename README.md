# SolarMiningOptimizer
A Python/Selenium-Script to get the photovoltaic electricity production from a SMA Sunny Tripower (Solar Inverter) Web-Interface (LAN) and adjust the NiceHash-Quick-Miner GPU-Mode-Settings of a MiningRIG according to the current energy production. 

The script is designed in a very modular fashion and all important values are defined as constants in the script head. 

I was not able to use the NiceHash-API, because it is still not updated to work with NHQM.
